For this assignment, I was tasked with creating a functioning website that allows a user to do a timed quiz, and save their high score, or even see other people high score. Although I wasn't able to accomplish all of the assignment within the given timeframe, I still got enough done to explain what I was shooting for within the assignment.

The idea behind the code is to first link the Javascript to specific tags within the HTML, so that I can easily access and change the contents of these tags while the code is processed. From here, I set an array of objects; each object is comprised of both a question and its coorelating answers. When the website loads the contents of the page are applied through the work of my Javascript variaables: welcomeScreen and startButton. Once on this page a user can press the start button, which triggers a click event that is linked to the startQuiz variable. The startQuiz variable is the starting domino of the rest of the code. After startQuiz is called, a timer starts counting, and the code within the content divs in the HTML is cleared and replaced within new code that states the first question and its set of answers. Had the code been completed to my liking, the rest of the code would run through a similar process. Switching inbetween questions whenever an answer is given. Simultaniously storing the result of each answer given. Once the user is out of questions, or out of time. The quiz would end, and the user would be presented with their score, which they could apply a username to, and have it saved to local storage.
